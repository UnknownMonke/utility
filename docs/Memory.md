**Heap Space** :

- Used by the JVM to allocate memory to Objects (and not primitives).
- The GC runs in the Heap to free memory used by Objects with no reference.
- Any Object in the Heap has global access anywhere in the application.

**Stack Memory** :

- Contains methods-specific values and references to other Objects in the Heap used in the method.
- Primitives are stored here.
- Objects are stored in the Heap and referenced in the stack.

**Young Generation** :

- **Eden Memory** :
    - All new Objects are created there.
    - When Eden is filled, a minor GC is performed. All survivors Objects are moved into the Survivor stack (S0, S1).
- The survivors are always stacked inside one of the two stacks in order to gain performances. The other stays empty.
- Objects that survive many GC cycles are moved into the Old Generation Memory (threshold of age).

**Old Generation** :

- Contains long-lived Objects.
- GC is performed when the stack is full, but takes longer than the minor GC inside Eden.

**Permanent Generation** :

- Contains application metadata required by the JVM, SE libraries, classes, methods.
- Not a part of the Heap.
- Holds its own GC when full.
- Structure :
    - Method area : class structure (runtime constants, static variables), code for methods & constructors.
    - Memory pool :
        - Store immutable Objects, like Strings (ex: String pool).
        - Can belong to the Perm or Heap depending on the JVM implementation.
    - Stack memory.

### <u>**Garbage Collection**</u> :

- Remove non referenced Objects.


- All GC event are "Stop the world" :
    - All application threads are stopped until completion.
    - Minor GC is fast and the stop is unnoticeable.
    - Major GC is long and may cause timeouts in highly responsive applications. the duration depends on the strategy used for GC.

*Steps* :

1. Marking
2. Sweep (deletion)
3. Compacting (compact remaining Objects)

***GC Types*** :

1. <u>*Serial GC*</u>
    - Simple mark-sweep-compact with young and old gen structure.
    - Used for small standalone apps, small CPU or low memory footprint apps.


2. <u>*Parallel GC*</u>
    - Spawns N serial GC threads for Young Generation running in parallel for N CPU cores. Old GC is still single-threaded.


3. <u>*Parallel Old GC*</u>


4. <u>*Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector*</u>
    - Runs GC concurrently with app threads for old GC, to minimize downtime.
    - Young Generation is in parallel, not concurrent.


5. <u>*G1 GC (Garbage First)*</u>
    - Will replace CMS.
    - Parallel, concurrent and incrementally compacting low-pause GC.
    - No Young or Old Generation, memory is divided into multiple equal-sized Heap regions.
    - First collects region with lesser live data.
    - Can meet a downtime target requirement specified by the developer, with high probability.
